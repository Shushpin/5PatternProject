**Purpose:**
The Contact Management System project is aimed at providing a flexible and efficient way to manage contact information. It allows users to add, view, and filter contacts based on various criteria. The system provides a modular and extensible architecture, making it easy to add new features and functionalities in the future.

**Design Patterns Used:**

**Singleton Pattern:**
Purpose: Ensures that there is only one instance of the ContactBook class throughout the application.
Implementation: The getInstance() method of the ContactBook class returns the singleton instance of the class, ensuring that only one instance is created and shared across the application.

**Observer Pattern:**
Purpose: Allows the ContactListView to observe changes in the ContactBook and update its display accordingly.
Implementation: The ContactListView class implements the ContactBookObserver interface and registers itself as an observer of the ContactBook. When the ContactBook is modified, it notifies all registered observers, including the ContactListView, which then updates its display.

**Strategy Pattern:**
Purpose: Separates the algorithms for filtering contacts from the ContactBook class, allowing different filtering strategies to be applied dynamically.
Implementation: The NameFilter class implements the Filter interface, defining a strategy for filtering contacts based on their name. This allows the ContactBook to use different filter strategies interchangeably without modifying its core logic.

**Decorator Pattern:**
Purpose: Extends the functionality of the ContactBook class by adding logging capabilities without modifying its existing code.
Implementation: The ContactBookWithLoggingDecorator class decorates the ContactBook class, intercepting calls to the addContact() method to log information about the added contacts before forwarding the call to the underlying ContactBook instance.

**Factory Pattern:**
Purpose: Provides a way to create instances of the NameFilter class without exposing its internal construction logic.
Implementation: The NameFilterFactory class encapsulates the creation of NameFilter instances, allowing clients to create filters using a simple factory method without needing to know the details of the filter construction process.

**Conclusion:**
The Contact Management System project demonstrates the effective use of design patterns to create a modular, extensible, and maintainable software solution. By leveraging patterns such as Singleton, Observer, Strategy, Decorator, and Factory, the project achieves separation of concerns, promotes code reusability, and enhances the system's flexibility and scalability. These patterns enable easy extension and modification of the system's functionality, making it adaptable to changing requirements and ensuring robustness in handling contact management tasks.
